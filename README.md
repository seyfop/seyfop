### Hey there 👋

**`Engineer/Developer/Creator`**

After producing contents for social media platforms and reaching millions of views and a hundred thousand followers in a short time period, I understood better that our time is the mobile era. For this reason I decided to become a mobile developer in the IOS ecosystem, which I have been using for a long time. I have been sharing the applications that I have learned and developed from the courses on my website on a daily basis.
